# ElytraMayhem
This is a Minigame Plugin, where all players will be teleported to a random location on the world where they'll need to fight to the death using the items in the loot chests. There's a catch though, as every player will have an elytra (and some fireworks) and the loot chests will spawn in the air. This plugin is built around Spigot, and supports versions 1.12.x and 1.17.x! Make sure to download the right version!
